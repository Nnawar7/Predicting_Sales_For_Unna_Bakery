# Predicting_Sales_For_Unna_Bakery
Unna Bakery is a small business that bakes traditional Swedish cookies in the United States. 
It only uses organic ingredients. It is founded in 2015. 
Main Objective: Forecast Sales using regression Models.
I tried Xgboost regression and Linear Regression to predict Sales.
